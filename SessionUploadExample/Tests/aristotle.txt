1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the good

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
has rightly been declared to be that at which all

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
things aim. But a certain difference is found among ends; some are activities, others are products apart

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
from the activities that produce them. Where there are ends apart

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
from the actions, it is the nature of the products

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to be better than the activities. Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics wealth. But where such arts fall

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
under a single capacity- as bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall under yet others- in all of these the

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
ends of the master arts are to be preferred to all the

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
subordinate ends; for it is for the sake of the former that the

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
latter are pursued. It makes no difference whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions,

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the sciences

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
just mentioned. If, then, there is some end of the

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
things we do, which we desire for its own sake (everything else being

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
desired for the sake of this), and if we do not

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
choose everything for the sake of something else (for at that

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
rate the process would go on to infinity, so that our desire would be empty

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and vain), clearly this must be the good and the chief

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
good. Will not the knowledge of it, then, have a great influence

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
on life? Shall we not, like archers who have a

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
mark to aim at, be more likely to hit upon

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
what is right? If so, we must try, in outline at least, to determine what it is,

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and of which of the sciences or capacities it is the

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
object. It would seem to belong to the most authoritative art and that

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
which is most truly the master art. And politics appears

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
to be of this nature; for it is this that ordains which of the sciences should be studied

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
in a state, and which each class of citizens should learn and up to what point they

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
should learn them; and we see even the most highly esteemed of capacities to fall under this,

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
e.g. strategy, economics, rhetoric; now, since politics uses the rest of the sciences, and since,

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
again, it legislates as to what we are to do and what we are to

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
abstain from, the end of this science must include those of the others, so that this

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
end must be the good for man. For even if the

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
end is the same for a single man and for a state, that of the state seems at all

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
events something greater and more complete whether to attain or to preserve; though it is worth while

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
to attain the end merely for one man, it is finer and more godlike to attain it for

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
a nation or for city-states. These, then, are the ends at which

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
our inquiry aims, since it is political science, in one

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
sense of that term. Our discussion will be adequate if it has as much clearness as the subject-matter admits

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
of, for precision is not to be sought for alike in all discussions, any

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
more than in all the products of the crafts. Now fine and

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
just actions, which political science investigates, admit of much variety and fluctuation

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
of opinion, so that they may be thought to exist only by convention, and not by nature. And

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
goods also give rise to a similar fluctuation because they bring harm to many people; for before

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
now men have been undone by reason of their wealth, and others by reason of their courage. We

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
must be content, then, in speaking of such subjects and with such premisses

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
to indicate the truth roughly and in outline, and in

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
speaking about things which are only for the most part true

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and with premisses of the same kind to reach conclusions that are no better. In the same spirit,

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
therefore, should each type of statement be received; for it

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
is the mark of an educated man to look for precision in each class

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
of things just so far as the nature of the subject admits; it is evidently

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
equally foolish to accept probable reasoning from a mathematician and

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
to demand from a rhetorician scientific proofs. Now each man

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
judges well the things he knows, and of these he is a good judge. And so the man who

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
has been educated in a subject is a good judge of that subject, and the man

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
who has received an all-round education is a good judge in general. Hence a

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
young man is not a proper hearer of lectures on political science; for he is inexperienced in the

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
actions that occur in life, but its discussions start from these and are about

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
these; and, further, since he tends to follow his passions, his study will be vain

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and unprofitable, because the end aimed at is not knowledge but action. And it makes

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
no difference whether he is young in years or youthful in character; the defect does not

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
depend on time, but on his living, and pursuing each successive object, as passion

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
directs. For to such persons, as to the incontinent, knowledge brings no profit; but

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
to those who desire and act in accordance with a rational principle knowledge about such matters will

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
be of great benefit. These remarks about the student, the sort of treatment to be expected, and
